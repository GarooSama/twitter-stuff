The script should be provided with Twitter & Imgur API keys in lines 16-25, and a tweet URL in line 46.
It will iterate through the replies of the tweet and match replies that contain specific keywords (blacklist.txt) OR the reply author has a high follower count.
Matched tweet details are saved into a generated CSV along with a screenshot link of it in case it gets deleted.
The use case of this script is very specific, and that is to expose tweet interaction manipulation in Saudi Twitter by user groups that reply to each other's ads.
